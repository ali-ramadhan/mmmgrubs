MMMGRUBS: Molecular Motion Movies and Geometry Reconstruction Using Bayesian Statistics

This was my attempt at reconstructing molecular geometries using Bayesian inference and inverse modeling (in Stan). I couldn't get the Markov chain to sample at all, so it doesn't work right now. See chapter 6 of [Molecular movies and geometry reconstruction using Coulomb explosion imaging](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/12190) for more details.
